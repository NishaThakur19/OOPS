        "●\t🔁 Method Overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters in the same class.

        "🧠 Why is Polymorphism Crucial? Code Reusability:\n",
        "●\tPolymorphism allows you to write generic code that can work with objects of different classes. This means you can reuse the same method in different contexts without rewriting code for each type of object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Maintainability:\n",
        "\n",
        "●\tSince polymorphism enables different classes to have methods with the same name, you only need to update a method in one place (the class). If you want to change how a specific type behaves, you can simply override the method in that class.\n",
        "Simplified Code:\n",
        "\n",
        "●\tIt makes the code cleaner and more readable. You don’t have to deal with different function names for each class—just use the same method name, and the right version gets executed based on the object.\n",
        "Supports Dynamic Behavior:\n",
        "\n",
        "●\tWith polymorphism, Python can determine at runtime which method to call, based on the object type. This leads to more flexible and dynamic behavior.\n",

        "\n",
        "●\tPolymorphism is great for extending functionality. As you add new classes, you don’t need to modify existing code—just override methods in new classes. The existing polymorphic code will continue to work without changes.\n",

        "\n",
        "●\tThrough inheritance, you can reuse existing code (methods and properties) without having to rewrite it.\n",
        "●\tOnce a class is written and tested, it can be reused in different programs.\n",
        "●\tThis leads to less code duplication and saves time in future development.\n",
        "✅ 3. Flexibility and Extensibility:\n",
        "\n",
        "●\tPolymorphism allows you to use the same method name for different object types.\n",
        "\n",
        "●\tYou can extend existing classes (using inheritance) without altering the original code, making it easy to introduce new features.\n",
        "●\tThis leads to flexible systems that can adapt to new requirements.\n",
        "✅ 4. Encapsulation:\n",
        "\n",
        "●\tEncapsulation keeps the internal state of an object hidden and only exposes a public interface (via methods).\n",

        "✅ 8. Increased Security:\n",
        "\n",
        "●\tOOP allows you to control access to data through getter and setter methods, which helps in protecting data integrity.\n",

        "\n",

        "🔧 How Multiple Inheritance Works in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "●\tPython supports multiple inheritance by allowing a class to inherit from multiple parent classes. When a method is called on an instance of the child class, Python follows the MRO to determine which method to execute, based on the class hierarchy.\n",

        "\n",
        "●\tIn Python, both the str and repr methods are used to define how an object is represented as a string. However, they serve slightly different purposes:\n",
        "1.\tstr Method:\n",
        "●\tPurpose: The str method is used to define the informal or user-friendly string representation of an object. It is meant to be readable and is called by the str() function or when you print an object.\n",
        "●\tUse case: It should return a string that is easy to read and gives a clear description of the object, useful for end-users.\n",
        "2.\trepr Method:\n",
        "●\tPurpose: The repr method is used to define the formal or official string representation of an object. It is meant to be unambiguous and can often be used to recreate the object. The output of repr is intended for developers, especially for debugging.\n",

        "Avoiding Explicit Parent Class Names:\n",
        "\n",
        "●\tUsing super() ensures that the child class code is more maintainable and extensible because it doesn't rely on hardcoded parent class names. This is particularly helpful when you change the parent class or add more levels to the inheritance hierarchy.\n",
        "Ensuring Proper Initialization:\n",
        "\n",
        "●\tsuper() is often used in the init method of a child class to ensure that the parent class’s initialization method is called properly. This allows the child class to inherit and extend functionality from the parent class.\n",
